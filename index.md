## **Deciding on a Research Question - 5/31/20**

### **Area of Research Interest:**
COVID-19 pandemic

### **Research Topic:** 
The impact of widespread disease on pollution

3 questions about COVID-19: 
 - How well-prepared is the average American household for the economic impact of COVID-19?
 - How closely does COVID-19's impact on pollution follow Kuznets Curve?
 - How has COVID-19 affected air quality?

**Research Question:** <span style="color:red">What effect will a reduction in anthropogenic activities have on air pollution?</span>

I chose this question because I was wondering if human activity is the cause of pollution and whether decreasing human activity would have a significant or notable effect on the air quality. For example, in several cities in China, the amount of smog in the air forces people to wear masks. An upside of COVID-19 is that it has helped us ocnduct an experiment and its results can show a lot about how humans affect air quality.
