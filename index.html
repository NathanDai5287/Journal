<h3>5/31/20</h3>
<p>Area of research interest: COVID-19 pandemic
    Research Topic: the impact of widespread disease on pollution</p>
<p>3 questions about COVID-19:</p>
<ul>
    <li>How well-prepared is the average American household for the economic impact of COVID-19?</li>
    <li>How closely does COVID-19's impact on pollution follow Kuznets Curve?</li>
    <li>How has COVID-19 affected air quality?</li>
</ul>
<p>What is the correlation between COVID-19 and the amount of air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide or benzene?
</p>
<p>I chose this question because I was wondering if human activity is the cause of pollution and whether decreasing
    human activity would have a significant or notable effect on the air quality. For example, in several cities in
    China, the amount of smog in the air forces people to wear masks. An upside of COVID-19 is that it has helped us
    conduct an experiment and its results can show a lot about how humans affect air quality.</p>

<h3>6/10/20</h3>
<p>Research Question: How have various social policies affected the quality of the air? What effect does air
    pollution
    have on the fatality rate of COVID-19?</p>
<p>Part 1:<br>
               Independent Variable:<br>
                          different policies enacted by the government<br>
               Dependent Variable:<br>
                          air quality<br>
    Part 2:<br>
               Independent Variable:<br>
                          air quality<br>
               Dependent Variable:<br>
                          COVID-19 fatality rate</p>
<p><ins><strong>Social Policies</strong></ins></p>
<p>These could be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>state of emergency declared</li>
    <li>stay-at-home order</li>
    <li>banned gatherings</li>
</ul>
<p>The dependent variable could easily be measured. I just have to decide what to observe.</p>
<p><ins><strong>How does air pollution affect the fatality rate of COVID-19?</strong></ins></p>
<p>This is going to be a hard question to answer. The fatality rate cannot be accurate because the total confirmed
    cases
    depends on the testing capacity.</p>

<h3>6/10/20</h3>
<p><ins><strong>Inaccuracies of the Fatality Rate</strong></ins></p>
<p>COVID-19 has infected many more people than have been confirmed. Asymptomatic cases make counting the total cases
    impossible.</p>
<p>Compared to other diseases, COVID-19 is a lot harder to count. For example, with Ebola, a very small fraction of
    cases are asymptomatic, which makes getting accurate numbers a much less tedious task.</p>
<p><ins><strong>My Plan</strong></ins></p>
<p>I will look at the more general trend of the fatality rate. I can use a logistic regression to obtain the
    best-fit
    line. With that line, I can see if there is a trend in the fatality rate. I will see if long-term exposure to
    air
    pollution has an effect on the fatality rate.</p>
<p>I will see if places with infamously-bad air pollution have higher fatality rates <ins>compared to neighboring
        regions with similar responses to the outbreak</ins>.</p>

<h3>6/13/20</h3>
<p>I did not clearly understand this paper as I did the others.</p>
<p>Here is what I think they did:</p>
<p>They used the CMAQ model to estimate air pollution. First, they tested how accurate it was. They used the model
    on
    the cities in China. They decided that it was accurate, so they started using it to make prediction.</p>
<p>They came to the conclusion that this reduction in anthropogenic activities was not enough to avoid air pollution
    buildup.</p>
